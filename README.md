Rackspace Cloud Security and Support Services User Guide

Security and Support services include:

* Cloud Identity
* Cloud Feeds

This repo is a place to collect ideas for future document development. 
When the Security and Support Services User Guide exists, it'll resemble the Core Infrastructure User Guide at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/.
